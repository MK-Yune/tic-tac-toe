## Description
Tic-tac-toe implemented with [svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

Tic-tac-toe is a two player game, *X* and *O*, who mark the spaces in a grid in turn. The game ends when either player places their marks in a row diagonally, horizontally, or vertically, and that player wins the game. Also, there is a possibility of a draw when all the spaces are filled with marks in a way that there is no rows placed in a row.

This project is a web implementation of tic-tac-toe. Here's the list of features:

- 3x3 ~ 10x10 grid
- a (stupid) game AI that marks randomly
- a game AI that employs the *minimax* algorithm
